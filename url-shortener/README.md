# URL Shortener

A URL Shortener is a service that converts long URLs into short, unique links while maintaining redirection to the original URL when accessed. Popular services like Bit.ly and TinyURL operate on this principle.

## Understanding the Problem Statement

### Functional Requirements

‚úÖ Generate a short, unique URL for a given long URL.

‚úÖ Retrieve and redirect users to the original long URL when the short URL is accessed.

‚úÖ Ensure uniqueness of short URLs.

‚úÖ Support high read traffic efficiently.

### Non-Functional Requirements

‚úÖ Scalability ‚Äì The system should handle millions of URL requests.

‚úÖ Low Latency ‚Äì URL redirection should be near-instantaneous.

‚úÖ High Availability ‚Äì The system should remain operational under high traffic.

‚úÖ Persistence ‚Äì Data should be stored reliably for future retrieval.

### Constraints & Assumptions

- URLs are assumed to be valid and unique per user request.

- The short URL should be 6-8 characters long.

- The system is expected to handle 100M+ URL mappings efficiently.

## High-Level System Design

### Architecture Overview

The system consists of:

1Ô∏è‚É£ API Layer ‚Äì Handles URL shortening and redirection requests.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Database ‚Äì Stores short URL ‚Üí long URL mappings.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cache ‚Äì Improves read performance for frequently accessed URLs.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Load Balancer ‚Äì Distributes traffic across multiple servers.

### Component Interaction

#### üìå Shorten URL Request:

- User submits a long URL via an API.

- The system generates a unique short code.

- Data is stored in a database and optionally cached for quick retrieval.

#### üìå Redirection Request:

- User enters the short URL in their browser.

- The system looks up the corresponding long URL in cache or database.

- If found, the user is redirected to the original URL.

## Database Design

Since we need fast lookups and scalability, we can use either SQL or NoSQL.

### SQL Database (Relational Approach - MySQL, PostgreSQL)

```
CREATE TABLE urls (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    short_url VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    long_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
- Pros: ACID compliance, structured queries.

- Cons: May not scale well for extremely high traffic.

### NoSQL (Key-Value Store - Redis, DynamoDB)

- Key: short_url (e.g., "abc123")

- Value: long_url (e.g., "https://www.example.com/blog/how-to-code")

- Pros: Fast reads, horizontally scalable.

- Cons: Less structured than SQL.

**Decision: If we expect billions of URLs and need fast access, NoSQL (Redis/DynamoDB) is preferred. Otherwise, SQL works for smaller-scale deployments.**

## Generating Unique Short URLs

To create a unique short URL, we use Base62 Encoding (characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9) since it efficiently compresses numerical IDs into short strings.

### Approach 1: Base62 Encoding (Recommended)

- Convert an incrementing ID into a Base62 string.
- Example:
    - ID 12345 ‚Üí Base62 encoding ‚Üí dnh
- Advantages:
    - ‚úÖ Generates unique, short URLs.
    - ‚úÖ No collisions, since ID is unique.

```
import string

BASE62_ALPHABET = string.ascii_letters + string.digits

def encode_base62(num):
    result = []
    while num:
        num, rem = divmod(num, 62)
        result.append(BASE62_ALPHABET[rem])
    return ''.join(result[::-1])

```

## Redirecting Users

When a user accesses a short URL, the system should:

- Check Cache (Redis): If the URL mapping exists, return immediately.

- Query Database (If not in cache): Retrieve the long URL and update cache.

- Redirect the user to the long URL.

### API Endpoint (Express.js Example)

```
app.get('/:shortUrl', async (req, res) => {
    const shortUrl = req.params.shortUrl;
    
    // 1. Check Cache (Redis)
    let longUrl = await redis.get(shortUrl);
    
    // 2. If not found in cache, fetch from database
    if (!longUrl) {
        const record = await db.findOne({ short_url: shortUrl });
        if (!record) return res.status(404).send('URL not found');
        longUrl = record.long_url;
        await redis.set(shortUrl, longUrl, 'EX', 86400);  // Cache for 24 hours
    }

    // 3. Redirect to Long URL
    res.redirect(longUrl);
});
```

**Caching in Redis significantly improves performance by avoiding frequent database lookups.**

## Scaling the System

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Caching (Redis)

- Store frequently accessed URLs in Redis to reduce database reads.

- Expiry set to 24 hours to prevent stale data.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Load Balancer

- NGINX or AWS Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple API servers.

- Prevents single-point failure and improves response time.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Partitioning

- Use sharding (partitioning URLs by hash of short code) to distribute load.

- Example: URLs starting with a-m ‚Üí DB1, n-z ‚Üí DB2.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ URL Expiry Mechanism

- Store a TTL (Time-to-Live) field in the database.

- Periodically delete expired URLs to free up space.

## Extending the System

### Additional Features

‚úÖ Custom Short URLs ‚Äì Allow users to specify custom aliases (e.g., short.ly/myarticle).

‚úÖ Analytics & Tracking ‚Äì Track click counts, user locations, and timestamps.

‚úÖ User Authentication ‚Äì Users can manage their shortened URLs.
